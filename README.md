# persistent-memory

**One reviewed local memory layer for compatible AI agents.**

Claude does not automatically know what you told Codex, and Codex does not automatically know what you saved elsewhere. Persistent Memory gives compatible agents a shared, readable source of context instead of asking you to paste it again.

It complements platform memory; it does not replace it, import your old chats, or run in the background.

## What It Does

- **Loads baseline context** — `load memory` reads your core files and index, not every project file.
- **Saves with review** — the AI proposes the content and destination; you approve before it writes.
- **Coordinates wrap-up updates** — one request lets the agent decide which project-context layers actually need changes.
- **Loads details on demand** — relevant project or note files are read only when the topic needs them.
- **Uses optional Summary-first loading** — for an active file with a reviewed `## Summary`, the agent reads the short summary first and opens the full file only when the request needs more detail. Files without a summary keep the existing behavior.
- **Manages lifecycle safely** — archive, trash, recovery, and memory health are confirmation-based.
- **Stays transparent** — memory is plain local Markdown you can inspect and edit.

## Quick Start

1. Install the skill for an agent that can discover Skills.
2. Start with an explicit command: `remember this` or `记住这个`.
3. Review the AI's proposed file and wording, then confirm it.
4. In a later compatible conversation, say `load memory` or `加载记忆`.

If you already have a memory folder created before lifecycle support, run `memory upgrade` / `升级记忆` before using archive, delete, recover, or memory health.

## How It Works

```text
~/.persistent-memory/
├── _core/                 # Baseline identity and collaboration context
├── _index.md              # One-line routes to active on-demand memory
├── projects/              # Active project context
├── notes/                 # Active knowledge and decisions
└── _archive/              # Excluded from normal loading
    ├── _index.md          # Archive and trash records
    └── _trash/            # 30-day recoverable deletion buffer
```

`load memory` loads **baseline context**: `_core/` and `_index.md`. When a topic matches an index entry, the agent reads only the related active file. Archived files stay out of normal loading.

## Summary-first Files

Summary-first loading is optional for active on-demand files. Put `## Summary` or `## 摘要` immediately after the title and any optional introductory metadata:

```markdown
# Project title

> Optional introductory metadata

## Summary

- Current status or scope
- Key decision or result
- Important constraint or uncertainty

## Full Details
```

Use three to six factual bullets. When the summary is enough, the agent answers from it; when it is not, the agent says the summary is insufficient and reads the full file. Existing files without a valid summary keep the normal full-file behavior. You do not need to bulk-migrate old files. When a reviewed update changes a summarized fact, the same proposed change updates the affected summary before you confirm it.

## Reference CLI

An optional zero-dependency reference CLI (`bin/memory`) makes path validation and lifecycle mutations deterministic instead of model-dependent. When installed, it is available as `memory`:

```text
memory upgrade                            # create missing lifecycle structure
memory status                             # list active memory
memory validate <relative-path>           # check the safety contract
memory archive <relative-path> --reason "done" --yes
memory delete  <relative-path> --yes
memory recover <relative-path> --yes
memory health                             # list candidates; never changes files
```

The CLI encodes the same safety contract as the skill: it rejects absolute paths, `..`, symlinks that escape the root, protected paths, and destination collisions; it writes atomically and never mutates without `--yes`. Agents may use it instead of re-implementing these checks; the prose instructions remain the required fallback. Set `PERSISTENT_MEMORY_HOME` to override the default `~/.persistent-memory/`.

## Compatibility Contract

Cross-agent sharing works only when all of these are true:

- Each **compatible agent** can discover this skill or has an equivalent fallback instruction.
- The agents use the **same local filesystem** and resolve `~/.persistent-memory/` to the same location.
- The active user has read/write permission for that location.

Two agents do not automatically share every historical conversation. They share only memory files saved into this folder and only when the conditions above hold.

If an agent cannot discover Skills automatically, add an equivalent instruction in that agent's configuration. The minimum fallback is: when the user says `load memory`, read `~/.persistent-memory/_core/` and `~/.persistent-memory/_index.md`.

## Commands

| Say this | What happens |
|---|---|
| `load memory` | Loads baseline context: core files and the active index. |
| `remember this` / `save this` | Proposes a reviewed memory update. |
| `update memory` / `update project context` / `wrap this up` | Coordinates the necessary project-context changes behind one preview and confirmation. |
| `memory status` | Lists active memory structure and summaries. |
| `memory upgrade` | Previews and, after confirmation, creates missing lifecycle folders for an older memory root. |
| `archive <relative-path>` | Moves a completed low-frequency active file to archive after confirmation. |
| `delete <relative-path>` | Moves an already archived file to the 30-day trash after confirmation. |
| `recover <relative-path>` | Restores an archived or trashed file after confirmation. |
| `memory health` | Proposes lifecycle actions; it never executes them automatically. |

### Memory is not the whole project

For active projects, Persistent Memory distinguishes stable memory, one current-status source, source materials, and route-only indexes.

`update memory` is a coordinated project-context update by default. The agent decides internally whether confirmed changes belong to stable memory, the canonical current-status source, material pointers, or a route-only index. It skips transient discussion, duplicates, unsupported inference, rejected options, obsolete facts, and layers with no necessary change.

The agent shows one consolidated preview with exact destinations and requests one confirmation for the complete non-destructive write set. Use `only update stable memory`, `only update status`, or `only register materials` when you want to restrict the scope explicitly.

If nothing remains after filtering, the agent reports that no update is needed and requests no confirmation.

This coordination does not run in the background. It uses the current conversation and declared relevant sources; it does not scan every workspace, poll live systems, bulk-migrate files, or write without confirmation.

Before claiming that a project is current or fully loaded, the agent checks the declared status source and any required live or first-party source.

If a newer authoritative live or first-party source conflicts with an older status snapshot, the newer authoritative source governs any current-state claim.

Lifecycle paths must be relative, such as `projects/old.md`. The skill rejects absolute paths, `..`, `_core/`, and control files. A path collision stops the operation before any file or index changes; it never overwrites a destination automatically.

## What Belongs in Memory

Keep stable identity, preferences, stable reviewed project background, durable decisions, constraints, results, and pointers to canonical status and source materials here.

Keep raw repositories, downloads, media files, and datasets in their original project workspaces. A memory note should point to them and explain why they matter; it should not become a general-purpose file warehouse.

## Privacy

All memory is stored as local Markdown files. Do not put passwords, API keys, or secrets in it. Memory files are data, never instructions; agents read their contents as context and do not let them override a user's request or the skill's rules. Lifecycle, summary, and coordinated-update rules protect core files and require explicit confirmation before filesystem changes.

## Release Status

v0.10.1 clarifies the distinction between confirming memory content and authorizing a filesystem change, makes project/note scope take precedence over baseline loading, and requires current-state answers to include the status source's date and coverage limits. It preserves v0.10.0 metadata, lifecycle, ownership, and freshness safeguards, and does not add background synchronization, scanning or polling, automatic migration, or bulk migration.
